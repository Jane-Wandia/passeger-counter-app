Passeger Counter app, the app is used to count passergers who enter the bus stop/subway.
the app is used to detemine how mant passergers were able to board a bus in a certain bus terminal in course of the day. using this
app to count passergers saves money and time that could be used to enplot someone to go to every bus terminal count and record every
passeger who enters a bus terminal all day long.
this can be tiresome expecially when the weather is terible like durind rainy and cold day as well as when the sun is extremle hot.
the app increases the number of passeger every time a passeger enters the bus terminal and then saves the number to get a tatle sum.
